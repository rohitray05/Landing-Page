             <p id="para-2" class="para">Let’s be honest, very few people want to wear hearing aids. Although there have been huge improvements in technology, most people don’t use them simply because they are still big and ugly. 
                However, Dr. Marco Vietor and Paul Crusius wanted to change this perception with a revolutionary device developed by the top hearing aid engineers from Signia.</p>
            
            <p id="para-3" class="para">After many years of research and development, Signia’s (formerly Siemens) team of engineers came up with a game-changing hearing aid.</p>
        
             <p id="para-4" class="para"><span class="bold">The result:</span>A hearing device that packs the latest German technology in a design so small, it disappears completely inside the ear. It’s called the Silk Px by Signia.</p>
